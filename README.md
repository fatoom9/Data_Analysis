# 📊 Real World Data Wrangling with Python 🐍

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates various data wrangling techniques using Python to clean, transform, and organize real-world datasets. The goal is to prepare raw data for further analysis or machine learning models by performing tasks such as: **Data Cleaning** 🧹, **Data Transformation** 🔄, **Handling Missing Data** ❓, **Merging Datasets** 🔗, and **Feature Engineering** 🛠️.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following Python libraries: **Pandas** 📂, **NumPy** 🔢, **Matplotlib/Seaborn** 📈, **Openpyxl** 📄, and **Requests** 🌐.

## 🧑‍💻 Installation
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-world-data-wrangling-python.git`  
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
   `cd real-world-data-wrangling-python`  
3. **Install the required dependencies**:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ⚙️ Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to see the data wrangling in action. Example usage:  
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
df['new_column'] = df['existing_column'] * 2
print(df.head())
## 📂 Data Sources  
This project uses data from the following sources:  
- [Kaggle - Data Science Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- [Open Data Portal](https://www.opendata.gov/)  
Make sure to download and place the datasets in the `data/` directory for the scripts to run properly.

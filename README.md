📖 Overview
In real-world scenarios, data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and unstructured. This project showcases Python-based techniques for:

Data Gathering: Retrieving data from APIs and CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
Data Analysis: Visualizing data to uncover trends and insights.
📊 Datasets
This project uses the following datasets:

NYC Arrest Data

Source: NYC Open Data
Contains arrest records with fields like borough, offense category, arrest date, and location.
Socio-Economic Data

Source: NYC Open Data API
Provides socio-economic indicators for NYC boroughs, such as population density, income levels, and unemployment rates.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Languages:

🐍 Python
Libraries:

📦 pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
🔢 numpy – Numerical operations
🌐 requests – Fetching data from APIs
📈 matplotlib and seaborn – Data visualization
📝 jupyter notebook – Interactive coding environment
🔄 Project Workflow
Data Gathering:

Fetch data from APIs and CSV files using requests and pandas.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
Data Transformation:

Merge datasets and create new calculated fields.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data trends using charts and graphs.
Insights and Conclusions:

Summarize findings and insights based on analysis.
🚀 Key Features
✅ API Integration: Fetch real-time data from RESTful APIs.
✅ Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
✅ Merging Datasets: Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis.
✅ Visualizations: Create insightful charts using matplotlib and seaborn.
